## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed to **strengthen React expertise** by migrating an application originally built with **vanilla JavaScript** into a **modern, component-based React application**.
The project uses **Vite** as the build tool and prepares the structure for integration with **REST APIs**, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Key Learning Goals

* Set up a React project with Vite.
* Refactor HTML into JSX.
* Develop and structure reusable React components.
* Manage data flow with `props` and `children`.
* Organize the folder structure for scalability.
* Integrate with external APIs using `fetch` and `axios`.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **React** – UI library.
* **Vite** – Lightning-fast build tool.
* **JSX** – Syntax extension for JavaScript.
* **CSS** – Styling (migrated from previous project).
* **REST API** – Dynamic data integration.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MayzaMendesRodrigues/web_project_around_react.git
cd web_project_around_react
```

2. Create the React project with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest .
# Select: React → JavaScript
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

4. Configure scripts in **`package.json`** and server port in **`vite.config.js`** (default: 3000).

## 🌐 API Integration

The application fetches and renders **dynamic content** through REST API requests.
Data can be consumed using either **fetch** or **axios**, centralized under `src/services/` for clean architecture.

## 🚀 Next Steps

* [ ] Migrate to **TypeScript** for static typing.
* [ ] Add **unit and integration tests** (Jest + Testing Library).
* [ ] Implement **global state management** (Context API or Zustand).
* [ ] Set up **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions.
* [ ] Enhance **mobile-first responsiveness**.
* [ ] Add **JWT authentication**.
